# Blood Thirst
A simulation of bat swarms and their interaction with bait and their homes(a bat house in this case).

## Target Behavior
I wanted to implement bat swarming behavior. 

In terms of the component behaviors:

Alignment: They all try to align with each other esp. when there is a target.

Coherence: The bats seem to cluster together when hounding a target, but they are a bit loose sometimes.

Separation: Swarms have a tendency to disperse and come back together.


### Two Additional behaviors:
Attraction: The bats may target their food and swarm until they are full or the bait is depleted.

Homing: This is like attraction, except bats will go back hom after they are full. When they are hungry they come back out.


### Other
Bats are fast and can maneuver sharp turns. 


## Artist Statement
I want the user to feel the erratic yet organized nature of bats. I achieved this by making the bats fast and hound bait. When they are full, they rush back to their bat house.

To improve, maybe I could have used sprites instead of drawing because that flapping took some considerable time.
